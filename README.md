*Summary*: Data on respiratory responses of crickets, grasshoppers, jumping spiders, lynx spiders, isopods, and tadpoles under varying contexts of predation. Data collected between Jun - Sept 2019.

All code is contained in [Analysis.R](Analysis.R)

Data are the raw outputs from respiration measurements and are contained within the data folder. Files beginning with an 8 digit date correspond to aquatic metabolic measurements. All other files correspond to the terrestrial respiration measurements. See code comments for additional details.
